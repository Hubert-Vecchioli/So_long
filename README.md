A simple 2D game made with MiniLibX, 42's custom graphics library.
The objective is to collect all items in the maze before exiting through the door.

The bonus for this project allows for creative freedom. I chose to make a Pac-Man clone!
The game's features, which I chose myself, are detailed in the project's folder.

Use `make` to compile the program into an executable `./so_long`. Then run so_long followed by the relative path to a `.ber` map. (Refer to the subject for map creation details.) The maps folder contains some sample maps, and the bonus/maps_bonus folder contains additional maps designed specifically for the bonus.
