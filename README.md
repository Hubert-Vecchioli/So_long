A simple 2D game made with MiniLibX, 42's custom graphics library.
The objective is to collect all items in the maze, while avoiding enemies, before exiting through the door.

Use `make` to compile the program into an executable `./so_long`. Then run so_long followed by the relative path to a `.ber` map. (Refer to the subject for map creation details.) The maps folder contains some sample maps.
